Linear Programming Assignment #1
Jonathan Turner and Chris Wailes

Our solver for this assignment is built with (we hope) a modular style of C, so that we can extend it further 
with optimizations that relate to our final project for the class.  For Jonathan, this is a OpenCL-based solver 
for LP.  For Chris, this is likely an OpenMPI-based solution.  To wit, we wanted to make sure that the solution 
was well-engineered using good C best practices and did not attempt to optimize the path to the solution.

We implemented general form initialization and simplex for this project.  Chris took the simplex duties, while 
Jonathan implemented initialization, file parsing, and mathprog output (for debugging).  

Along with our source, we're submitting a small set of unit tests which we hope to grow over the coming weeks as 
we begin to optimize the codebase further.  These unit tests cover initialization variables, variable splitting 
of free variables, and of course, simplex itself.
