An experimental linear program solver, plpsolve is capable of solving any feasible general linear program.  There are currently some numerical stability issues that probably won't go away for a while.  This is because the main focus of this project is to explore parallelization methods for general form simplex and not to implement the fastest or most-correct solver out there.

In reality this code shouldn't be used to solve actual problems, but is probably a good example of how to code general-form simplex (including initialization) and then how to parallelize it in different ways.
